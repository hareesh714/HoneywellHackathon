This is deployed under my own domain and can be found at https://boondiladdu.com/Login

*****************************************************************************************************
There are two logins only provided as of now with hardcoding due to time limitation.
*****************************************************************************************************

1. Admin
=========

username/Email: Admin@gmail.com
password: BoondiLaddu1

With the Admin login, you can view all the orders that need to be delivered and delivered orders already.
For pending delivery orders, you can click on "Track Order" button to track the order where it is.
There is no Maps API integration yet in the code, so just added an image for UI look.

2. Delivery person:
===================

username/Email: Delivery@gmail.com
password: BoondiLaddu2

With the Delivery login, you can view the recent delivery assigned that need to be delivered.
Some stats like number of orders delivered, ratings received and five star ratings and the completed orderes list.


*****************************************************************************************************
I created this login/Admin/Delivery page with React JS.
Used Boostrap for CSS and deployed using Google Firebase.
*****************************************************************************************************

*****************************************************************************************************
I did not get time to create REST APIs from MongoDB Atls DB to use them as for login and data fetch.
So created data using https://designer.mocky.io/ with sample data for data display.
